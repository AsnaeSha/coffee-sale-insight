EXCEL PROJECT

**Project Purpose:
The Coffee Sales Dashboard in Excel is crafted to offer a comprehensive view of our coffee business. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and loyalty programs.

**About the Data:
For this project, I had data stored in a CSV file, which I organized into three different sections called Orders, Customer, and Quantity. These sheets contained information about our coffee sales, our customers, and the quantities of coffee they ordered.

To make this data easier to work with, I used a lookup function to combine the important details from these different sheets into one place, which I called the "Customer" column. This combined data now gives us a lot of useful information about our customers' coffee orders, how much coffee they bought, and other important details.

So, in simple terms, I took messy data from different places and made it neat and organized in one sheet, helping us understand our coffee sales better.

Approach Used:
The approach involved data manipulation and visualization. The dashboard showcases Total Sales Over Time, allowing us to track revenue growth and identify seasonal patterns. Sales by Customer reveals our top-performing clients, empowering us to focus our efforts effectively.

To enhance user interactivity and insights, I incorporated three slicers. These slicers enable users to filter data by Coffee Size, Coffee Type, and the presence of a Quantity Card among customers. This dynamic functionality grants a deeper understanding of our coffee offerings and the impact of loyalty programs on sales.
